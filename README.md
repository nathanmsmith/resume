# Nathan Smith's Resume

My resume. Instead of writing my resume in Microsoft Word, Google Docs, or LaTeX, I decided to try something different: the content of my resume is written in YAML and then compiled HTML by [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/). From the HTML, a PDF is created using [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/).

## Development

Requires Yarn. First `git clone` then run `yarn`. Then,

```
yarn start
```

Go to `localhost:8080`!

## Build

### HTML

```
yarn build-html
```

### PDF

```
yarn build-pdf
```

## Hire Me

Think my resume looks good and want to talk about jobs? I'm currently looking for full-time software engineering positions upon my graduation in June 2021. Let's talk: [nathan.smith@ucla.edu](mailto:nathan.smith@ucla.edu).
